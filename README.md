# Video Enhancement for drone video using FPGA
Nowadays Drones are being widely used for surveillance and various other activities. The video 
stream produced by the drone can be disturbing or can contain noise data which might reduce the 
quality of the video stream. The video stream can be enhanced so that there is no disturbance in 
the video stream. The video enhancement can be done in real-time with the help of Field 
Programmable Gateway Array (FPGA) which reduces the processing time with low energy 
consumption. Our project mainly focuses on enhancing the quality of the video stream using 
Enhanced Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN), Contrast Limited 
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), Gamma Correction and Saturation Adjustment by 
integrating the image source in the drone with the FPGA.
